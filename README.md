## ðŸ”§ **Puzzle Setup**

### 1. **Puzzle Scriptable Object**
- The puzzle is generated based on a `PuzzleNodesRopes` `ScriptableObject` 
- This `ScriptableObject` has two lists, `NodesSettings` and `RopesSettings`
- Each element of `NodesSettings` determines a starting position of a puzzle's node, and some position where that node should be for the puzzle to be solved.
- Each element of `RopesSettings` determines what two nodes are connected by a rope, starting with ID of 1.
